sometimes i just want to do everything

i want to make music, draw things, design things, code things, write things, heck i even had a whole storyboard written one day for some animated story i wanted to make. not gonna lie, i feel very creative, though sometimes i don't have any ideas coming up and just feel empty.

well, reality is when i open a new project, spend an hour trying to understand the basics, and then suddenly feel lost, like HOW do people actually get good at this stuff?? i keep watching tutorials, trying new tools, but nope that doesn't do anything

and it's weird because i do learn things. some friends do know that i tried to make music and art a lot of time, but it never feels enough. maybe it's because i compare myself too much to people that make it seem like they can do it effortlessly. i know they've spent years practicing but still it's hard not to feel stuck when all i see are finished projects and i'm here trying to figure out where to even start

i HATE that feeling of wanting to do something but not being able to. it's like my brain knows what i want to make but my hands just don't follow. or worse, i start something, get super motivated for like a day, and then it just fades. i open the file again and it feels dead

october 12th: i can't even put my thoughts into words anymore, i'll write later

i KNOW that's how it usually goes. you can't be inspired all the time, but it's frustating. i think i'm scared of never getting good. what if i just keep learning forever and never actually reach the point where i can make something i'm proud of??

and sometimes i tell myself it's fine, that i'm just learning, that it's normal to struggle. but then a week passes, then a month, and i realize i haven't made anything. i feel so guilty, feels like i'm wasting time wanting to do stuff instead of actually doing stuff

it's stupid, really. i want to create so badly, but i can't seem to push past that line between wanting and doing. maybe that's just how it is for now, idk it's like i'm constantly chasing a version of myself that knows what they're doing. someone who can just sit down and create without overthinking everything. but i'm not that person bruh, i keep thinking maybe i should just focus on one thing but that feels impossible too, because the moment i choose one path, i start missing all the others. i want to make everything. i want to be good at everything. and that's kind of killing me slowly because it's just not possible
