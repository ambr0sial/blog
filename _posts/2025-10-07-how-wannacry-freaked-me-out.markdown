title:  "how wannacry freaked me out"

i still remember the first time i heard of a really impacting malware, even though i was young i still remember it, and it was wannacry. not just because it was everywhere on the news, but because it made me stop and go, wait.. we literally rely on machines for everything now?? like hospitals, banks, government stuff: all frozen because some random code was propagated everywhere. it's honestly wild, buttt fascinating

i've always been drawn to malware and weird corners of tech, but wannacry was different. it wasn't some tiny experiment in a virtual machine or a github poc, it was literally out there, in the wild, making grown-ups panic (also probably the first time i've ever heard of ransomwares i'm pretty sure). and suddenly the abstract idea that systems could fail in catastrophic ways wasn't abstract anymore, it was oh so real. and it showed how fragile everything actually is

and the more i thought about it, the more i realized it's not even just the machines themselves. it's how much we've tied our lives to them. everything depends on them being perfect. when you just stop everything you're doing and really think about it, that's kinda insane. humans have survived literal wars and plagues but some code feels like it could shake the world. maybe it's proof that humans are just bad at letting go of control. or maybe we just like the illusion of control!!

well anyways, wannacry was certainly something lmaoo
